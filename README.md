## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project 

 Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

### Dataset

- Location `dog-project/dogImages` populated from the [dog dataset] at (https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip) 

-  Location `/dog-project/lfw` populated with images from the [human dataset] at (https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).  

-  Pre-trained models use features from [VGG-16 bottleneck features](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogVGG16Data.npz) for the dog dataset.  located at location `path/to/dog-project/bottleneck_features`.
